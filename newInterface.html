        <p>&#8230;</p>
        <p>&#8230;</p>
        <p>&#8212;the hell am I?</p>
        <p>I yell: &quot;<span style="color: #ffffff">Hello?</span>&quot;<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">huh?</span></span><br />
            Nothing. Not even the sound of my voice. At least, I don't think&#8212;<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">hello?</span></span><br />
            &#8212;wait. Did I hear something?<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">is someone there?</span></span><br />
            No. Just endless white void, as far as my eyes can see. It's like an ocean &#8212; or maybe a desert.
            There's no texture, no sound, not even the steady thud of my own heart. I try to look at my hands &#8212;
            can't see them, can't even <em>feel</em> them. It's like they're not there. I try to close my eyes, but I
            still see white.<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">please talk to me.</span></span><br />
            Am I dead?<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">i'm so alone.</span></span><br />
            Think. I've got to think. I try coaxing up some memory, some thought of how I might have ended up in this
            miserable place. There was a room &#8212; right. A room, and an old woman, and her wheezing laughter, and
            then there was the grenade, and&#8230;<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">i'm so scared.</span></span><br />
            &#8230;oh.<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">please say something.</span></span><br />
            Right.<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">i've been here so long.</span></span><br />
            Shit.<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">i just want to hear a voice.</span></span><br />
            There was an explosion, and &#8212; without even thinking &#8212; I dove down through the veil to escape. As
            deep as I could. Deeper than I even knew was possible. And now, I'm&#8230;<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">maybe you're scared too?</span></span><br />
            <em>Shit</em>.<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">don't be scared.</span></span><br />
            What the hell is this place? How many layers deep have I gone? I concentrate, focusing &#8212; searching for
            the invisible tether that connects me to my world. I wrap my consciousness around it &#8212; and start to
            pull.<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">wait what are you &#8212; no.</span></span><br />
            I drag myself out of this endless ocean of white — inch by excruciating inch. I feel myself press against
            the boundaries of this place. I feel myself pushing <em>through</em> them&#8230;<br />
            <span style="font-size:80%;"><span style="color: #ffffff">please, don't go.</span></span><br />
            &#8230;and then I feel something grab me.<br />
            <span style="color: #ffffff"><em><strong>YOU FUCKING WHORE HOW FUCKING DARE YOU</strong></em></span><br />
            I can feel my limbs. My hands, my feet, my body &#8212; I still can't see them, but I can <em>sense</em>
            them. Something has me by my ankle. It's trying to pull me 'down' &#8212; deeper into the layers beneath
            this one. A level below whatever this&#8230; emptiness is.<br />
            <span style="color: #ffffff"><em><strong>THIS IS MY REALM HERE I AM GOD</strong></em></span><br />
            I pull with everything I've got. It feels like an anchor tied to my foot &#8212; my muscles spasm as a sharp
            stabbing pain lances up through my calf and knee. It feels like whatever's pulling on me might take my whole
            foot with it.<br />
            <span style="color: #ffffff"><em><strong>I WILL RIP OUT YOUR FUCKING EYES</strong></em></span><br />
            If it means getting the hell out of here, it can <em>have</em> my foot. Hell, it can have the whole damn
            leg. I rear my other boot up and slam down, feeling the heel collide with&#8230; <a
                href="/scp-000">something</a>. Suddenly, my ankle slips free.<br />
            <span style="color: #ffffff"><em><strong>AAAUGH FUCK FUCK FUCK</strong></em></span><br />
            I reel myself up, squeezing against the membrane, pressing through it &#8212;<br />
            <span style="color: #ffffff"><em>please no please i'm so sorry i'll be good don't go &#8212;</em></span></p>
        <hr />
        <p>&#8212; and into an apartment.</p>
        <p>Thick, plush brown carpet coats the floor. The walls are a hideous shade of peach-pink. The air is stale and
            old. I squeeze the pommel of my .45 and give the room a quick sweep, looking for anything out of place. Am I
            back? Is this Chicago? <em>My</em> Chicago?</p>
        <p>Everything looks ordinary: Table, desk, sunlight pouring in through a window. I take a step toward the light.
        </p>
        <p>Outside, I see a small corner diner; further in the distance, I see a hot-dog cart. I see sidewalks and
            lamp-posts, store-fronts and automobiles&#8230;</p>
        <p>&#8230;but not a single soul.</p>
        <p>When I take a step back, my boot sinks deep into that thick carpet. I look down. It's not <em>just</em>
            brown; there's streaks of black, gold &#8212; even an occasional wispy curl of copper-red. Something about
            it catches my eye. I crouch down to examine the fibers. They're fine &#8212; too fine. The material
            is&#8230;</p>
        <p>Hair.</p>
        <p>My eyes drift to that grotesquely pink wall. I start to notice the imperfections &#8212; blemishes,
            pock-marks, scars&#8230; beauty marks.</p>
        <p><a href="/scp-002">Skin</a>. It's made of goddamn skin.</p>
        <p>I close my eyes, grab hold of that tether, and climb as fast as I can. I feel myself slip through &#8212;</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&#8212; a world of rotting, putrid flesh filled with the deafening roar of billions upon billions of buzzing
            flies, gathered into blankets of writhing black so dense they blot out the sky &#8212;</p>
        <p>&#8212; an abandoned factory so immense that it contains all of Chicago, contains the entire sky, contains
            <em>the sun itself</em> &#8212;</p>
        <p>&#8212; Chicago, but choked with smoke and flame; the sound of gunfire rattling off in the distance, with
            every single door throughout the city flung open wide &#8212;</p>
        <p>&#8212; a sea of screaming faces, all squeezed together so tightly that they constantly burst into a bright
            pink-red pulp, only to reform an instant later &#8212;</p>
        <p>&#8212; and then &#8212;</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&#8212; I'm in what looks like a hospital room. There's only one door, and it's behind me; solid steel. It
            looks like the sort of thing you'd use to keep the monsters out.</p>
        <p>A wizened old woman stands in front of me, cloaked in dark fabric.</p>
        <p>Or maybe it's for keeping the monsters <em>in</em>.</p>
        <p>I point my .45 straight at her ugly mug. &quot;Alright, lady. Talk.&quot; I'm trying to pull on my tether,
            but it's not working. I can't sense it &#8212; as if it's just been snipped.</p>
        <p>Her eyes brighten with amusement. Something snakes its way out from beneath her clothes &#8212; it looks
            like&#8230; hair. Dozens and dozens of strands of gray hair, writhing out past her feet and slowly extending
            across the floor.</p>
        <p>She clucks her tongue. &quot;Really, now. You don't recognize me? After you went through so much trouble to
            find me.&quot;</p>
        <p>Iga Volodya. My eyes narrow. &quot;Your face is different. Also? Pretty sure you're dead.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I have many faces. More than there are stars in the sky.&quot; She chortles to herself, then grins. Her
            teeth gleam like a platter full of steak-knives. &quot;Today you have seen two. Perhaps &#8212; if you are
            very clever &#8212; you will see more.&quot;</p>
        <p>Alarms shriek around us. The room is flooded with a bright, flashing red light.</p>
        <p>&quot;But enough reminiscing. I did not pull you here to chatter. We have business to attend to, you and I.
            Follow me &#8212; I will show you the way back to your precious city, <em>Yashenka</em>.&quot;</p>
        <p>She turns, and we &#8212;</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&#8212; are back in Chicago. The city is in a state of decay. Buildings have come crashing down; cars are
            flung over to their sides, torn asunder. The streets are covered in rubble.</p>
        <p>In the distance, I see the Roanoke Building. It's littered with dozens of human-sized holes, with the
            contents of each room dangling out like flapping tongues. I feel a dry, scorching wind blowing against my
            back. A strange force tugs at me &#8212; drawing me toward the source of that heat.</p>
        <p>Iga Volodya walks ahead, moving with a surreal calm.</p>
        <p>I look back. The sky is a horrible shade of tangerine; in the distance &#8212; far past the city &#8212;
            there is a bright, burning light. It is toward this light I feel myself being pulled.</p>
        <p>I turn to Iga. A newspaper brushes past my ankle; I catch the snippet of a headline before it blows away.</p>
        <p><tt>MYSTERIOUS FORCE DRAWS CORPSES TOWARD&#8212;</tt></p>
        <p>We keep walking. &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Have you ever thought about how many ways the world can end?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Is that what this is? The end?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;It is <em>every</em> end.&quot; She looks back to me with that horrible grin. &quot;And do you know why
            none of them have come to pass?&quot;</p>
        <p>I open my mouth to reply, and &#8212;</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&#8212; we're standing in a kitchen. A family of four sits in front of us, preparing to enjoy a warm meal.
        </p>
        <p>But the family isn't right. They aren't people &#8212; not anymore. They're made of pink, pulsating flesh;
            heaps of it, piled into the vague semblance of human beings. Too many arms, too few legs. Bulging mounds of
            meat that throb with every heartbeat.</p>
        <p>The food is the same. Plates full of quivering tumors, spreading their tendrils out across the table. To my
            left, I think I see the family dog &#8212; just a mound of rolling, convulsing muscle. It extends a
            ribbon-like 'tongue' out to lick at a bowl filled with wriggling, squealing tissue.</p>
        <p>Iga Volodya surveys the scene beside me. She looks annoyed.</p>
        <p>&quot;Your work?&quot; I ask.</p>
        <p>&quot;People always think so. But no &#8212; we did not do this.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;'We'?&quot;</p>
        <p>She looks to me. &quot;Practitioners of Nälkä. The Children of Ion.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Sarkites.&quot;</p>
        <p>She nods. &quot;Like yourself.&quot;</p>
        <p>I tighten my grip on the .45. &quot;I ain't one of you.&quot;</p>
        <p>The flesh around us stirs. Although they have no eyes, the family seems to have noticed us. A deep, dark,
            hateful growl emerges from their bodies. I point my pistol at the biggest one.</p>
        <p>&quot;But you are, Yashenka. You see it just as clearly as me. The corruption. The <em>wrongness</em>. And
            you fight it.&quot;</p>
        <p>With a horrible, gurgling roar, the family lunge to their feet. I squeeze the trigger, and &#8212;</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&#8212; I'm pointing my gun at a wall. We're back on the city streets. It's night-time; there are people
            here, running past us and yelling. I glance behind me &#8212; we're standing in front of the Chicago
            Theater. I can hear the sounds of screams coming from inside.</p>
        <p>&quot;Again: Do you know why these ends do not come to pass?&quot;</p>
        <p>A man in a suit leads a squad of police past us, charging for the theater's doors. They're packing serious
            heat &#8212; and their faces are all business. I turn to the city skyline. It's dark, but I can make out
            distant fires. The screams aren't just coming from inside the theater. I think I hear them everywhere. All
            around us.</p>
        <p>My eyes drift toward the theater's marquee:</p>
        <p><tt>FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY &#8212; THE HANGED KING, LIVE ON RADIO</tt></p>
        <p>&quot;They do not come <em>because</em> they are ends. Because to end is to cease. And our suffering is not
            meant to cease. Our suffering is to be eternal.&quot;</p>
        <p>I turn back to her, lowering my pistol. &quot;You done with the cryptograms, grandma?&quot;</p>
        <p>She smiles, exposing those sharpened teeth. &quot;And so we fight fire with fire; corruption with corruption.
            The universe is sick &#8212; and we seek to use that sickness <em>against</em> it.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Enough. Tell me who &#8212;&quot;</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&quot; &#8212; cut you open. Who's using you to harvest the worms &#8212; to help Weiss? Who's &#8212; ugh
            &#8212;&quot;</p>
        <p>The ground beneath us is a spongy mishmash of colors churned together into a mush-like brown. The smell of
            sweetness is overpowering; it leaves me doubled over and choking. The earth gives underneath my weight. My
            left foot sinks down into the loamy soil with a horrible <em>schlrp</em>. A thick, white froth seeps up from
            around my ankle. That sickening sweet odor intensifies.</p>
        <p>Iga looks down at me.</p>
        <p>&quot;Someone who perverts our beliefs. Someone you will find. Someone you will stop.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I don't &#8212;&quot; The earth beneath me is slowly sucking me in. My ankles are gone; my calves are
            sinking. More of that cream gushes out, rising up past my knees. I try to push myself up, but my palms sink
            down. &quot;I don't &#8212; work for you.&quot; My eyes focus on the landscape behind her. Rolling hills,
            plateaus, mountains of mush. I think I see a rock formation poking up somewhere &#8212; no, not rocks.
            That's the top of a steeple &#8212;</p>
        <p>&quot;You do not work for me, but we are on the same side. The side of the angels. The side of
            <em>Ikunaan</em>.&quot;</p>
        <p>Down to my waist, now. I try to move my legs, but the mush just squishes out of the way &#8212; and I sink
            faster. &quot;That's the side that eats babies, right? Just checking. I read your file. You're a goddamn
            monster.&quot; I'm about to drown in a sea of sugary mush and she's Baba Yaga. Pissing her off feels like
            the right move.</p>
        <p>She doesn't seem offended. Instead, she just smiles and reaches down to stroke my cheek with one of her
            gnarled, wrinkled fingers. &quot;Oh, my dear, dear little Yashenka,&quot; she coos. &quot;Of <em>course</em>
            I'm a monster. What else but a monster could ever hope to defy the stars themselves?&quot;</p>
        <p>Down to my shoulders, now. Her cruel hand snaps up and seizes me by the hair, forcing my head back; I open my
            lips to say something &#8212; maybe just to yell &#8212; but she spits straight into my mouth. Something wet
            and awful hits the back of my throat. I feel it burning &#8212; everything is burning. I feel like I'm on
            fire. Her voice rumbles above me, crooning with a hateful, loving snarl.</p>
        <p>&quot;Avenge me, Jacob Hartliss. Do it as a favor &#8212; from one monster to another.&quot;</p>
        <p>She whispers into my ear.</p>
        <p>The universe dissolves.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>The remains of a cramped little tenement room smolder around me. A wispy haze of smoke fills the space; the
            scent of burnt meat and burning wood is everywhere. The canisters have all shattered, spilling nauseous
            chemicals and glass shards across the floor. A fresh coat of charred Iga Volodya &#8212; with some scorched
            worm-meat thrown in &#8212; decorates the walls.</p>
        <p>Sirens wail in the distance.</p>
        <p>The wall behind me has all but disintegrated; I step over what's left of the door and into the hall. A family
            of four &#8212; ma, pa, two kids &#8212; stand at the other end of the hall, staring at me.</p>
        <p>I glance back at the ruin, then look to them. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
        <p>They rush back into their apartment, slamming the door behind them.</p>
        <p>I make my way down the stairs, out the door, and back into the bustling streets of Chicago. I take a good,
            long moment to savor the sights and smells of the Windy City &#8212; and then I go hunt down the nearest
            pay-phone.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>&quot;So it's not Sarkites.&quot; September sounds annoyed.</p>
        <p>&quot;I didn't say that.&quot; I rub at my neck. My voice is hoarse; I keep having to clear my throat.
            &quot;Just saying it ain't Iga Volodya.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;You're sure?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;About as sure as I am about anything. I got a name,&quot; I tell her, fishing in my pocket for another
            stick of gum.</p>
        <p>&quot;You already had a name.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, now I got a better one.&quot; My fingers tremble a little as I struggle to unwrap the foil,
            jamming the stick into my mouth. &quot;Wilhelm Reinhardt.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;<em>Doctor</em> Reinhardt?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Yeah. You know him?&quot; I stop to chew and give a smile to the flat-foots running by. They're chasing
            the fire-truck on its way to Volodya's former residence.</p>
        <p>&quot;He's a highly respected alienist and physician.&quot;</p>
        <p>Waitasec &#8212; physician. Didn't Weiss bring his personal physician with him to visit the stoolie who
            pulled that one-day Lazarus act? &quot;He ever work for Weiss?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;He's a private physician. It's possible, but&#8230;&quot; She sounds unconvinced.</p>
        <p>&quot;Pull whatever you got on him &#8212; send it to my office. Also, I'm gonna need&#8230;&quot; I take in
            a deep breath and steady myself. &quot;I'm gonna need a favor, September. Need you to arrange a
            meet-and-greet for me.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;With who?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Richard Chappell.&quot;</p>
        <p>The line goes quiet for a little. I let her have that one &#8212; hell, I wouldn't know what to say either.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;Are you&#8230; uh, are you sure?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I don't like it, but yeah. I'm sure.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Alright. Uh&#8230;&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Call my office tomorrow with the details. I'll be in.&quot;</p>
